## I have not written the android code for this app, I just converted the webapp that I have made into a android app.

## [Link to the app](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XVM5B1H/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=stddev+app&qid=1614920743&sr=8-1)

## Note: The app permissions required are internet and access to your files if you need to change your profile photo, amazon has not mentioned that properly.
